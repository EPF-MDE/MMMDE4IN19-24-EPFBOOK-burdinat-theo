### Setup
To install EPFBook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:EPF-MDE/MMMDE4IN19-24-EPFBOOK-burdinat-theo.git
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EPF-MDE/MMMDE4IN19-24-EPFBOOK-burdinat-theo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MMMDE4IN19-24-EPFBOOK-burdinat-theo
	```

3. Install node (v21.6.2):
   ```bash
   nvm install
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

EPFBook is now ready to run

## Usage

### Development mode
To run EPFBook in development mode (Nodemon), follow these steps:

1. Create or start the MongoDB server:
   ```bash
   npm run docker_create #If it has never been created before
   ```
   ```bash
   npm run docker_start #If you just want to start the server
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

4. Access to the app with admin IDs:

	**Username:** admin

	**Password:** admin

5. To exit MongoDB server:
   ```bash
   npm run docker_stop
   ```

The server will restart automatically on code update. You can stop the server using Ctrl+C.

### Production mode
To run EPFBook in production mode (PM2), follow these steps:

1. Dowload PM2 (only the first time):
   ```bash
   npm i --save --global pm2
   ```

2. Create or start the MongoDB server:
   ```bash
   npm run docker_create #If it has never been created before
   ```
   ```bash
   npm run docker_start #If you just want to start the server
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run pm2_start
   ```

4. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

5. Access to the app with admin IDs:

	**Username:** admin

	**Password:** admin

6. You can stop the app using:
	```bash
	npm run pm2_stop
	```

7. To exit MongoDB server:
   ```bash
   npm run docker_stop
   ```

The server will restart automatically in case of unexpected crash.

### Deploy EPFBOOK on a server

First 1 to 3 are to do only the first time.

1. Install NGINX - it will permits to set up a reverse proxy:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nginx
   ```

2. Update NGINX configuration to redirect HTTP requests on port 80 to port 3000:
	```bash
	sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.backupsudo 
	nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
	```
	Content to update:
	```
	server {
		listen 80; 
		server_name p3000; 
		location / { 
			proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:3000; 
			include /etc/nginx/proxy_params; 
		}
	}
	```

3. Restart NGINX:
	```bash
	sudo systemctl restart nginx
	```

4. Then you can run the app following [dev](#development-mode) or [prod](#production-mode) modes, and connect you to the app using the IP address of your server.

### Other features

#### ESLint

This project use ESLint to maintain a good code quality. You can check the code quality using the following command:
```bash
npm run eslint
```

#### Responsive

The application is responsive and can be used on mobile devices. All not essential long paragraphs are removed on the mobile version, and the menu and the different forms will adapt to the size of your device.

#### Handle the scenario where the id parameter does not match any student in the details view

If you try to access a student's details page for a non-existing id, you will be redirected to a "Student not found" page.

#### Basic Authentification

The app is using basic authentification on all its pages. You can use the app using the following credentials right after the setup:

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
| admin    | admin    |

You can add new users to the app by adding them in the *users.csv* file. As passwords are encrypted you have to encrypt your password before adding it to the file. To do so, run the hashPassword script:

```bash
./scripts/hashPassword.js
```

To connect on the API, you have to use a basic authentification Authorizer header. To know what you have to put inside, run these line and copy the result:

```js
node //Switch to node terminal
> "Basic " + Buffer.from("username:password").toString("base64");
```

## Rick and Morty API Example

This example demonstrates how to perform a basic API GET request to retrieve information about a specific character from the Rick and Morty API. We'll find out details about the character with ID 5.

### Documentation Reference

The detailed **documentation** of Rick and Morty API is available [here](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation#character).

### The request

To fetch details about the character with **ID 5**, we need to execute a **GET request** to the following URL:
   ```
   GET https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/5
   ```
I recommend you use [**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest/) to easily make your **API requests**.

### The result

We found that the character with ID 5 is **Jerry Smith** !
   ```json
   {
	"id": 5,
	"name": "Jerry Smith",
	"status": "Alive",
	"species": "Human",
	"type": "",
	"gender": "Male",
